# Object_detection
In this repo, I compare the performance of FasterRCNN with ResNet50 backbone and EfficientDet-B5 on wheat head multi-object detection.
The wheat head dataset can be obtained from here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection

# Train

```python
python train.py --run_name give_run_name --dir_input path_to_csv --dir_train path_to_images --num_classes num_of_classes_in_dataset
```
